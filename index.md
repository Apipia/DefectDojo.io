## What is Defect Dojo?
DefectDojo is a security tool that automates application security vulnerability management. DefectDojo streamlines the application security testing process by offering features such as importing third party security findings, merging and de-duping, integration with Jira, templating, report generation and security metrics.

## What does DefectDojo do?
While traceability and metrics are the ultimate end goal, DefectDojo is a bug tracker at its core. Taking advantage of DefectDojoâ€™s Product:Engagement model, enables traceability among multiple projects and test cycles, and allows for fine-grained reporting.

## How does DefectDojo work?
DefectDojo is based on a model that allows the ultimate flexibility in your test tracking needs.

* Working in DefectDojo starts with a Product Type.
* Each Product Type can have one or more Products.
* Each Product can have one or more Engagements.
* Each Engagement can have one or more Tests.
* Each Test can have one or more Findings.

The code is open source, and [available on github](https://github.com/rackerlabs/django-DefectDojo).

A demo installation can be [found over at PythonAnywhere](https://defectdojo.pythonanywhere.com/).
